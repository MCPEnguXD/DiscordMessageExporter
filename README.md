# DiscordMessageExporter
Easy to use Discord Message Exporter

The script stores your token after the first time you use it so you don't have to put it in again. The token is stored in settings.txt which is generated after a successful export

Before you use it make sure to run "pip install -r requirements.txt" inside the directory or run these commands: "pip install requests" "pip install tkinter"
